<p>The Extract Field refactoring creates a field which holds the selected expression as the value and replaces its occurrences by reference to this newly created field.
</p>
<p>You can opt to:
  <ul>
  <li>replace all occurrences of the expression
  <li>replace only a single occurrence of the expression
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  In order to invoke the refactoring, select an expression to be replaced with a field or place the caret over an expression and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:IntroduceField;</span>
  (<span class="control">Refactor | Extract | Field... </span>):
