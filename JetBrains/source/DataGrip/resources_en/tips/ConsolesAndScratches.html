<p><span class="emphasis">Database consoles</span> are SQL files in which you can compose and execute SQL statements.
    Unlike scratch files, consoles are attached to a data source. When you create a data source, a database
    console is created automatically. To open a console, right-click the data source and select <span
    class="control">Open Console</span> (or press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditSource;</span>).</p>
<p><span class="emphasis">Scratch files</span> are like consoles but they are not attached to a data source. Refer to
    scratch files as temporary notes or drafts for some code ideas outside the project context. To create a scratch
    file, navigate to <span class="control">File | New | Scratch File</span> (or press <span class="shortcut">
    &shortcut:NewScratchFile;</span>).</p>
<p><span class="emphasis">Scratch buffers</span> are simple text files without any coding assistance features. Scratch
    buffers can be used for simple task lists and notes to yourself. There is no dedicated menu item for the action
    to create a new scratch buffer, but you can use the <span class="control">Find Action</span> popup (<span
    class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoAction;</span>) and run the <span class="control">New Scratch Buffer</span>
    action.</p>
