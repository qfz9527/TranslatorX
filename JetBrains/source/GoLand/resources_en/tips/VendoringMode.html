            With the vendoring mode enabled, you build your application only with dependency packages that are stored
            inside your project under the vendor directory. In this mode, Go commands ignore dependency descriptions
            in go.mod and assume that the vendor directory holds the correct copies of dependencies. By default, when
            you use Go modules, the vendor directory is ignored during the build.
        </p>
        <p>In settings of the Go modules (vgo) project, navigate to <span class="control">Go | Go modules (vgo)</span>.
            Select the <span class="control">Vendoring mode</span> checkbox and click <span class="control">OK</span>.</p>
