            You can rename any field, function, type, variable, package, or any other symbol at the caret by pressing
            <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:RenameElement;</span>
            (<span class="control">Refactor | Rename</span>). The IDE will update all references of the renamed symbol.
        </p>
        <p>Also, the rename refactoring renames methods declared in interfaces. When renaming such methods, you can
            choose to rename their implementations as well.</p>
