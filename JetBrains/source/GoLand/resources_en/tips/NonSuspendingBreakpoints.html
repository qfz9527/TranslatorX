           You can set a breakpoint and log it in the console, or even get the stack trace
           of the breakpoint when it was reached (the code execution will not stop). To set additional
           settings for the breakpoint, set a breakpoint where you need it, and press <span class="shortcut">
           &shortcut:EditBreakpoint;</span>.</p>
