    <p>Mozilla rr is a tool that you can use to record, replay, and debug applications. The main idea of Mozilla rr
        is to help you catch non-trivial bugs. The rr tool records a program execution. So later, you can
        replay the failing execution in the debugger as many times as you need.</p>
    <p>From the <span class="control">Run</span> menu in the gutter, select <span class="control">Record and Debug

    <p><span class="emphasis">Note</span>: Mozilla rr is available only on Linux machines.</p>
