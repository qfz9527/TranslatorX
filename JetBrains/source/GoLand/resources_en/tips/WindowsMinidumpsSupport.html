<p>Windows minidump files record the state of a program as it is running, or as at the moment of a crash. To read a
    minidump file, you must have the binaries of your application and the dump file.</p>
<p>You can open and explore minidumps in the IDE. To open a minidump, navigate to <span
        class="control">Run | Open Core Dump</span>. Specify paths to the executable and the dump file. Click
    <span class="control">OK</span>.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis">Note</span>: You can create Windows minidumps only on Microsoft Windows operation systems.
    But you can analyze and debug your application on all supported operation systems.</p>
