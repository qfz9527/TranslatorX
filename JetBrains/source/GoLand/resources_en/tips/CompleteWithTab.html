            You can accept completion suggestions by pressing <span class="shortcut">Tab</span> instead of
            <span class="shortcut">Enter</span>. In this case the suggestion will
            replace the characters to the right of the caret.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another way to accept suggestions is by pressing <span class="shortcut">!</span>. In this case the
            suggestion will be added prepended with
            negation, which may be useful for boolean expressions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, you can enable accepting suggestions by using other punctuation characters
            (<span class="control">Settings | Editor | General | Completion | Insert selected variant by typing dot, space, etc.</span>)
