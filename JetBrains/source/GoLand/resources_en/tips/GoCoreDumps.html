    <p>Sometimes when you debug a program, you need to examine the code execution flow and understand the current state
        of a program. Go core dump is a file that contains the memory dump of running processes and their status
        during the life of a program.</p>
    <p>You can open and explore Go core dumps in the IDE. To open a Go core dump, navigate to <span
            class="control">Run | Open Core Dump</span>. Specify paths to the  executable and the dump file. Click
        <span class="control">OK</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Note</span>: you can create Go core dump files only on Linux machines. But you can view
        the dump files on any operating system that supports the IDE.</p>
