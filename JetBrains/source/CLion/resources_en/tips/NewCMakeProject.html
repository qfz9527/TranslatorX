  You can easily create new projects in CLion without writing a single line in CMake files – just select <span class="control">File | New Project…</span>.</p>
<p>
  You can also import a folder with C/C++ files via <span class="control">File | Import Project…</span> – CLion will automatically generate a CMake script for them and import the folder as a project.</p>
